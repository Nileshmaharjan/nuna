    "Greetings, I'm Olivia (Seool.an), who lives in Changwon, the Republic of Korea. I majored in Arabic language Linguistics and have a keen interest in foreign cultures. until recently, I worked as a Coordinator for International students at a regional University, and I found it to be a significantly rewarding experience. It's wonderful that I have traveled to various countries during my students years and had many opportunities to interact with people from different racial background. Meeting foreign friends, enjoying leisure time with them having conversations is still my daily hobby. I also enjoy reading books and listening to music, and (once in a while) playing music. =)",
